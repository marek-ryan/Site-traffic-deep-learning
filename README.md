- Exploratory data analysis of over 900 recipes to gain insights which lead to higher traffic and more subscriptions
- Data was cleaned and validated using pandas, with matplotlib and seaborn for vizualizations
- For deep learning, the data was normalized and split into test and train sections using sklearn
- TensorFlow was utilized to build a baseline model leading to a subsequent improved model with 73% accuracy on validation data in predicting which recipes will draw high traffic and thus increase revenue
